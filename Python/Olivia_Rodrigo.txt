Influences
Rodrigo has named Taylor Swift and Lorde as her idols and primary musical inspirations,[88] and once dubbed herself Swift's biggest fan "in the whole world".[89] Rodrigo later went on to give interpolation credits to Swift and Jack Antonoff on her song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" and retroactively credited Swift, Antonoff and Annie Clark on her song "Deja Vu".[90] In 2022, she called the White Stripes band member Jack White her "hero of all heroes".[91] Other stated influences on Rodrigo's debut studio album included Alanis Morissette, Kacey Musgraves,[92] Fiona Apple, St. Vincent,[93] Cardi B,[94] Gwen Stefani,[95] Avril Lavigne,[96] Billie Eilish, Halsey, Gracie Abrams[97] and Lana Del Rey.[98] Guts was primarily inspired by her punk and alternative rock influences, including Babes in Toyland and Rage Against the Machine.[99]

Rodrigo's voice type is soprano.[100][101] Media outlets generally describe her as a pop artist,[102][103] with songs ranging from pop rock,[104] teen pop,[105] and indie pop styles,[106] as well as 1990s alternative rock.[103] Rodrigo stated that she wants to be a songwriter and not "the biggest pop star that ever lived", and she chose to sign with Interscope/Geffen Records because its CEO John Janick praised her songwriting, not her "potential star quality".[4] Music journalist Laura Snapes called Rodrigo a "flag-bearer" for a new wave of songwriters who incline towards power ballads "that are as emotional as ever, but project that emotion inward, trading bombast for hush", and described her musical style as rooted in heartache, mental health, and sadness, without being melodramatic, expressing more realistic perspectives than resilient.[107]
