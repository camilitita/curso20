Carpenter responded to the controversy by saying that advance permission had been granted and added that "Jesus was a carpenter".[121][122][123] Bishop Robert J. Brennan relieved the pastor of his administrative duties and held a Mass of reparation which "restored the sanctity of this church and repaired the harm."[124] Subsequent investigation into the priest who granted permission for Carpenter to shoot the video has been linked to a federal criminal investigation of New York City mayor Eric Adams.[125]

Carpenter released her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet on August 23.[141] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 362,000 equivalent album units sold in its first week.[142] All songs from the album charted above top 50 on the Hot 100.[143] At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Carpenter received six nominations including the Grammy Award for Best New Artist while the album received nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year.[144] The album won for Best Pop Vocal Album while "Espresso" won for Best Pop Solo Performance.[145] A third single, "Taste" was also released alongside the album and debuted at number two on the Hot 100, making Carpenter the first act since The Beatles to chart their first three top five hits in the US during the same week.[146] The first three singles off the album remained simultaneously in the top ten of the Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks, a record for any female artist in history.[147] Carpenter also became the first artist in 71 years to spend 20 weeks atop the UK singles chart in a calendar year, with "Taste" also becoming the longest-running UK number one of 2024.[148] A deluxe version of the album is set to be released in February 2025.[149]

Artistry
Influences
Carpenter named R&B as a genre that often influences her work.[155] She cited Christina Aguilera[156][157] and Rihanna as her biggest musical influences.[158] Carpenter stated that Aguilera's 2002 song "Beautiful" helped her "showcase and develop [her] own voice",[159] citing Aguilera's vocals as an inspiration.[160] She has also named Aretha Franklin,[161] Whitney Houston and Etta James as early musical influences,[162] she cited Beyoncé as her genre-bending influence,[163] and cited Taylor Swift and Lorde as her songwriting influences.[164] She claimed that Swift's live performances and work ethic have inspired her.[129][127] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Carpenter said Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Aguilera were some of the artists who introduced her to pop music.[165]
Musical styles
Early in her career, Carpenter was described as a "teen pop singer".[166] Later on in her career, Carpenter began to embrace pop music, with I.D. writer Barry Pierce noting that after the release of Emails I Can't Send, she "can rightfully claim the title of fully fledged popstar".[20] Variety writer Thania Garcia noted that while Carpenter was "considered a Disney princess for years, her transition from child actor to pop star [...] has been slow, steady and intentional".[167] Carpenter felt that her transition from a Disney-star was hard, with Pierce noting that she has since had more autonomy over her work.[20] Carpenter noted in an interview with Vogue that her "prior music put forth a facet of herself that she didn't feel was authentic at the time".[168] Her stage presence has also been praised with Vogue writer Chelsea Sarabia noting that "as an artist and performer, [Carpenter] wields the full range of human expression as if it were an instrument of its own".[168]
Carpenter's albums contain elements of folk pop, acoustic, country, electropop and house music.[169][170] Her albums post-Singular: Act I have delved into styles such as dance-pop, trap, hip-hop, and R&B.[171][172][173] On her sound, Carpenter noted that her music has "elements of everything".[156] In an interview with Variety in 2024, Carpenter noted that she felt separated from her albums pre-Emails I Can't Send, noting that it was "largely due to the shift in who I am as a person and as an artist, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic".[167] Alex Hopper of American Songwriter remarked storytelling as a motif of Carpenter's songs.[174] Carpenter's voice has been described as a soprano.[175][176][177][178]
Songwriting
Carpenter has co-written most of her songs, with sole lyricist credits for two tracks on Emails I Can't Send; she has stated in interviews that she is the main songwriter on her songs.[179] Her preferred songwriting process is to start writing by deciding the song's title and building on from there, documenting her life experiences confessionally.[180] Producer Jack Antonoff, who collaborated with Carpenter on the production of her sixth album Short n' Sweet, commended the way she weaved humor into her music and her songwriting voice. Antonoff mentioned that he worked solely on the music of "Sharpest Tool" with Carpenter handling the lyrics.[181] Of Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter said "I would hope that if someone had never listened to my music before, and they listened to this album, they would leave it feeling like they know me better as a person."[182]
Carpenter also worked on the compositions of some of her songs, including "Espresso" and "Please Please Please".[183][184] She also performs her own musical accompaniment, with musical knowledge of the piano, bass, ukulele, guitar, and drums.[185] She played the guitar during her set on the Short n' Sweet tour,[186] and played the piano and electric guitar during her Coachella set in 2024.[187]

In 2017, Carpenter performed at the We Day California event.[191] That same year, Carpenter partnered with DoSomething's Love Letters Challenge, aimed to combat isolation for senior citizens.[192] Throughout her career, Carpenter has been an avid supporter of the LGBTQ+ community,[193][194] and in 2018, she participated in writing a love letter to the community for Billboard.[195] She noted that "When [fans] come to my shows with pride flags, screaming the lyrics at the top of [their] lungs, I hope [they] feel an overwhelming rush of love and safety."[195] In April 2020, Carpenter appeared in a charity version of "If the World Was Ending", which supported Doctors Without Borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.[196]
In June 2024, Carpenter announced she was partnering with the nonprofit PLUS1 on her Short n' Sweet Tour to create the Sabrina Carpenter Fund, dedicated to supporting the "well-being of people and animals", focusing on "mental health, animal welfare, and support for the LGBTQ+ community".[197] Later that month, it was also announced that her espresso-flavored ice cream collaboration with Van Leeuwen Ice Cream would have fifty percent of its profits benefit the Ali Forney Center, the largest nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to helping homeless LGBTQ+ youth.[198] In the leadup to the 2024 United States presidential election, Carpenter became the artist partnering with HeadCount that registered the highest number of voters in the year.[199]
